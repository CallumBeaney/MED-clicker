# MED Click Dictionary

### what is?
This is a Firefox extension that opens a link to a search query for a given word on the Michigan University Middle English Dictionary website when you double click it. You can change the settings in a menu when you right-click your mouse in the browser, changing: whether double clicking will open a tab; whether you want to search just for the headword or the whole entry; whether you want new tabs to open in the background or not.  

### why?
The Michigan University Middle English Dictionary is pretty much the best resource for looking up words on the internet, but unfortunately, according to a member of staff, forestalling an open-source MED has been their primary target until now. This way the proprietary data is not expropriated but at the very least, slow website navigation and general lookup UX can be slightly sped up by a simple "double-tap to search" function.
